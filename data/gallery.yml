        Due to the current global pandemic and related quarantines, as of now IKFF  is not able to offer live training courses CKT 1, CKT 2 or CMS.
        However, we are still providing high-quality in-depth educational courses for both individuals, small groups, and organizations via zoom live format.
        If you would like information about being trained or certified for your self, your group or your staff, please email stevecotter@ikff.net to request information.
