## The IKFF Standard for Excellence

Attending an IKFF certification course is not enough to earn certification. The student must also demonstrate technical competence to earn a prestigious IKFF certification. CKT and CMS students must pass the technical assessment with consistent form to receive IKFF certification

## CKT Level 1 Assessment:

CKT Level 1-candidates are required to perform a Fitness Test during the Level 1 course:

#### Men:

- Hand-hand Swing: 20kg x 100 – switching hands after each rep is completed
- 1 arm Clean& Press: 20kg x 16 reps per hand AND must work for the full 2 minutes on each hand (4 min set); 32 reps total non-stop
- Snatch: 20kg x 60 reps with only 1 hand switch (can do 30 each hand or any combo that totals 60 reps)
- Front Squat: 20kg x 30 reps AND must hold KB for entire 2 min

#### Women:

- Hand-hand Swing: 12kg x 100 – switching hands after each rep is completed
- 1 arm Clean& Press: 12kg x 16 reps per hand AND must work for the full 2 minutes on each hand (4 min set); 32 reps total non-stop
- Snatch: 12kg x 60 reps with only 1 hand switch (can do 30 each hand or any combo that totals 60 reps)

* Women under 45 kg can use 8kg and for men under 60kg can use 16kg; men and women over 55 years of age can use 16kg and 8kg, respectively

The successful completion of the CKT Level test involves completion of the Assessment with strict execution of form. If the CKT-candidate is not able to successfully complete the assessment or to demonstrate competence in one of more of the techniques, the student will receive a Certificate of Participation and will need to subsequently demonstrate correction of the techniques by providing video of the completed Assessment with corrected techniques.

CKT-candidates who are unable to pass the Assessment during the course, or who opt not to attempt the Assessment during the course, have a 3-month period post-certification course to submit their successful Assessment by video, and will receive certification upon grading of the video submission.

Active Certification

All IKFF–certified CKT and CMS trainers will maintain a commitment to continuous growth and development. The IKFF Assessments are how the CKT and CMS shows technical skill and is the criteria for professional standard. All CKT and CMS will stay current with technical practice,
by re-certifying every 2 years.
